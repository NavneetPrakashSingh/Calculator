# Assignment 2
### Application Design
#### Code Architecture
Code architecture consist of various classess using OOP principles. Each class has been assigned a specific functionality. Flow of the app will be more clearer by the architectural-sitemap provided in the [OneDrive link](https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/nv503662_dal_ca/EVdyloUco3RJnIOvAv7ficcB-4dB9cH2LeCMCO1rPHjQQw?e=j6RKOk).



#### Wireframe

Wireframe for the application can be accessed here : [OneDrive link](https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nv503662_dal_ca/EkKI3KGfWspBmuq9KqtsZsEBuHs5j2HfKiesvofrAUO5Fw?e=pHCzZO)

#### Coding Convetions:



| File Names    | Convention    |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Class files   | UpperCamelCase | 
| Resource Files          | lowercase_underscore      |   
| Layout Name          | underscore seperated      |  
| Variable Name          | camelCase      |  
| Icon | ic_ (Prefix)      |  



### USER EXPERIENCE

The following Heuristic principles have been followed, link of the screenshot of the principles are shown here : [OneDrive link](https://dalu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nv503662_dal_ca/EmPaDBMOr3pPg1ZukdeAgw8BWx43BIMd4VF1pc57czEa6A?e=bE89B9) 

1. Visibility of the system status : Memory feature shown on the display, gives user an idea of the current memory value.
2. Match between real world and system : Icon resembles a calculator
3. Consistency And Standard : Android Guidance have been maintained
4. Help users recover from errors : Display error message when divided by zero
5. Aesthetic & Miniistic design : No extra content shown
6. Help & Documentation : Help section has been added
7. Error prevention : Decimals are added only once
